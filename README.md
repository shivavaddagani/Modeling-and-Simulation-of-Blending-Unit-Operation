# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Blending-Unit-Operation
## Daiichi-Sankyo Europe and CSIR-IICT collaborated project <br>

### A Breif Intro to the Project <br>
### 1. Problems in Blending

Due to the size, density, etc. variations of API and Excipients(ingredients for phamaceutical tablets) in the feed mixture, they tend to segregate during the belnding process.<br>
Since every tablet has to have only the prescribed amount of API inside a tablet, and any excess amount of API in tablets will have effect on consumers, ""attaining blend uniformity is given utmost importance"".
