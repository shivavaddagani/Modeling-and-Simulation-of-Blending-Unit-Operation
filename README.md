# Modeling and Simulation of Blending Unit Operation (July 2017 - July 2020)
## Daiichi-Sankyo Europe(DSE) and CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology(IICT) collaborated project <br>

### A Breif Introduction to the Project <br>
### 1. Challenges in Blending

Due to the size, density, etc. variations of API and Excipients(ingredients for phamaceutical tablets) in the feed mixture, they tend to segregate during the belnding process.<br>
Since every tablet has to have only the prescribed amount of API inside a tablet, and any excess amount of API in tablets will have adverse effect on consumers, **attaining blend uniformity is given utmost importance.** <br>

=========================== Aim is to Attain Blend Uniformity ============================

### 2. What factors influence blending process
- Particle parameters(size, shape, density, etc.)
- Geometric paramters(blender shape, angle, baffles, etc.)
- Operating parameters(Feeding order, Rotational speed, composition, cohesion, time, etc.)

**By now I guess you have had a basic understanding into our project's Aim & the factors influencing blending process**

### 3. Overview of Simulation
- Carried out Discrete Element Method(DEM) Simulations for various ranges of parameters
- Evaluated blending perfromance using different sampling techniques
- Identified the ranges of operating parameters (Blender Speed,  Composition of API, % fill level inside the blender) which result in uniform blending

Below image shows how the mixture of API(green) and Excipients changes across time for different belnder speeds.
