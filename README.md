# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Blending-Unit-Operation
## Daiichi-Sankyo Europe(DSE) and CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology(IICT) collaborated project <br>

### A Breif Intro to the Project <br>
### 1. Problems in Blending

Due to the size, density, etc. variations of API and Excipients(ingredients for phamaceutical tablets) in the feed mixture, they tend to segregate during the belnding process.<br>
Since every tablet has to have only the prescribed amount of API inside a tablet, and any excess amount of API in tablets will have effect on consumers, **attaining blend uniformity is given utmost importance.** <br>

=========================== Goal is to Attain Blend Uniformity ============================

### 2. What factors influence blending process
- Particle parameters(size, shape, density, etc.)
- Geometric paramters(blender shape, angle, baffles, etc.)
- Operating parameters(Feeding order, Rotational speed, composition, cohesion, time, etc.)

### By now I guess you have had an intro into our projects goal & factors influencing belnding process.

- In this project we had to come up with blending process parameters which result in uniform blend
- Carried out Discrete Element Method(DEM) Simulations for various ranges of parameters

Below image shows how the mixture of API(green) and Excipients changes across time for different belnder speeds.

Lot more to tell, but will wind up in few sentences, always feel free to reach out to me for further details.

## Exciting project right!!
